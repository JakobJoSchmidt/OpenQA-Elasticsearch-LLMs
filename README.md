Repository for my master's thesis "Design and Implementation of an Open-Domain Question-Answering System with Elasticsearch and Language Models"

# Abstract
 
This paper presents the design and prototypical implementation of an Open Domain Question Answering (OpenQA) system, which is aimed at delivering precise answers to questions posed in natural language. It seeks to eliminate the generation of "hallucina-tions," meaning unsupported answers that can occur with language models like GPT-3, by relying exclusively on information contained in a database of unstructured texts for answering questions.The system is based on a Retriever-Reader architecture, which is augmented by a Re-Ranking component to utilize both lexical and semantic retrieval. The BM25 algorithm is employed for lexical retrieval, while semantic retrieval uses vector embeddings generated by a Dual-Encoder, queried with an approximate Nearest Neighbor search. A Cross-Encoder is deployed as a Re-Ranker, and a transformer-based, extractive QA model is used for the final answer extraction. Elasticsearch serves as the database. The paper discusses the theoretical foundations of OpenQA and provides an overview of relevant research work. The design decisions during the system's conception are based on a requirements analysis and are thoroughly justified. The implementation of the system is described in detail, and its performance is demonstrated through an evaluation. The achieved results indicate that the combination of retrieval methods, Re-Ranking, and the extractive Reader model constitutes a viable solution for the use case described in this work.
